- Even though our site is not finished, publishing it to netlify will let us test the entire development workflow
- To deploy to netlify create a `netlify.toml` file:

```
[build]
    command = "npm run build && npm run export"
    publish = "out"
```

- This file will tell Netlify how to build our site
- Push all your changes to your repo and log in to your [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) account. Select your nextjs blog repo and then deploy the site.
- If all went well, you site should be deployed to Netlify! Congrats ðŸ¥³
