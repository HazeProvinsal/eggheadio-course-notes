- Next.js has a `Head` tag where we can add metatags such as `title` or `og:title` to our site.
- To use `Head` just `import Head from "next/head"`
- Add the `Head` component to your `BlogPost` component and then add a `<title>` tag with the `post.title` and a `<meta property="og:title" content={post.title}/>`
- You can put any meta tags you want into here. ðŸ“œ [Open Graph protocol Docs](https://ogp.me) ðŸ’¡ Why don't you try adding the image you added as an "og:image"
