# Create a Next.js app from scratch with create-next-app

- Create a next app by running

```terminal
npx create-next-app my-nextjs-blog
```

- You can pick a template, but for this coleection we will start from scratch.
- `create-next-app` will install react, react-dom, and next using yarn
- cd into the directory you created and run code to open vscode.

```terminal
cd my-nextjs-blog
code .
```

- The entry point of our next.js application will be `pages/index.js`
- Run `yarn dev` to start the development server
- Changes are reflected in the browser without having to refresh the page
- The tiny widget in the right-hand corner of the screen tells us that the page is pre-rendered. **In Next.js we get server side rendering by default.**
