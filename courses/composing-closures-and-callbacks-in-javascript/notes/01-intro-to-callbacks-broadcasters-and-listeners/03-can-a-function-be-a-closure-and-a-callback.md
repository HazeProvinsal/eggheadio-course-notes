# Can a Function be a Closure and a Callback?

[ðŸ“¹ Video](https://egghead.io/lessons/egghead-can-a-function-be-a-closure-and-a-callback)

We can create a function that can be both

- A closure
- A callback

```javascript
let i = 0

let callback = (event) => {
  console.log(i++)
}

let anotherFunction = (fn) => {
  fn()
  fn()
  fn()
}

anotherFunction(callback)
```

We can see that `callback` is being passed to `anotherFunction` making it

- a callback because is being passed as an argument to another function
- a closure because it's capturing the variable `i` outside of it
