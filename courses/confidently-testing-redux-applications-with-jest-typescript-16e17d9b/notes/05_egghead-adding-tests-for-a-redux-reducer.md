# Adding Tests for a Redux Reducer

<TimeStamp start="0:15" end="0:25">

productSlice.ts has a reducer method used when we receive new products. We can test this method.

</TimeStamp>

<TimeStamp start="1:45" end="1:52">

Run the command `npx jest -- productsSlice` to run only the tests associated with the product slice file.

</TimeStamp>

<TimeStamp start="2:08" end="2:18">

Add `import products from "../../../public/products.json"` to be able to use mock product files in your tests.

</TimeStamp>

<TimeStamp start="3:30" end="3:45">

References to `productsReceived` should be changed to `receivedProducts`:

`import productsReducer, { receivedProducts } from "./productsSlice";` at the top of the file, and `const action = receivedProducts(products);` in the second test.

</TimeStamp>

<TimeStamp start="3:45" end="3:55">

Run the command `npx jest --coverage -- productSlice` to see the coverage generated by only testing this file.
