- Ensure there are no Signing Certificate errors in this same section
- Confirm version and build numbers are correct - increase build number if redeploying
- Select `Generic iOS Device` from simulators list
- In the menu click `Product > Archive` to build
- Once built the `Window > Organizer` window should automatically open
- Ensure you have [registered your app for distribution](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/distributing_your_app_for_beta_testing_and_releases)
- Click `Upload to App Store...` to deploy to test flight or the app store

> ❗Note: Xcode may display different options if you are running a newer version - follow [Apple's Distributing Your App for Beta Testing and Releases](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/distributing_your_app_for_beta_testing_and_releases) guide for more information.
