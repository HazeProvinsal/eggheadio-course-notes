## Prerequisites

[Gatsby Theme Authoring](https://egghead.io/courses/gatsby-theme-authoring)

## Course Goal

To publish a theme or 2 that work together. Go from ‚Äúyou have this monolithic site‚Äù to ‚Äúthe site is a set of composable themes with core themes backing them‚Äù that can be published and maintained in a way that others can use them.

## Course Summary

When you see the word ‚Äútheme‚Äù you might think of the visual aspects of a site or code editor where setting an option in one place can change the look everywhere.
Gatsby Themes take this idea to another level by allowing you to change and compose entire pieces of functionality.
In this advanced course, you will iteratively convert a fictitious SaaS website with marketing, eCommerce, blog, and dashboard pages into a set of horizontally composed Gatsby Themes.
After everything's been split up, you will build a deeper understanding of parent/child theme relationships by exploring the blog data model with schema customization APIs that allow us to create multiple child themes with data sourced from different node types.
