Capital vs ongoing expenses

Vertical and horizontal scaling

vertical more storage and computation
horizontal handle traffic

elasticity
shrink and grow.

<TimeStamp start="4:40" end="4:50">
  
  If you lose traffic without elasticity, you're eating the cost of server expenses **and** loss of revenue
  
</TimeStamp>

With effortless scaling, the safety of elasticity, and the low up front cost. It's no wonder that cloud infrastructure has become a 100 billion dollar industry.
