## About

In this course, Jason Lengstorf will take you from an empty project folder all the way through deployment of a Twilio-powered video chat app built on Gatsby.

Along the way youâ€™ll learn powerful concepts like dynamic route handling in Gatsby, form management with React Hooks, writing custom React Hooks, context management and reducers in React, handling realtime interactions in a React app, creating serverless functions in Twilio, and setting up a Twilio account to support realtime video calling.

## You will learn how to:
- Create dynamic web apps using Gatsby
- Create and configure a Twilio account for enabling video calling
- Initialize and manage realtime interactions in a web app
- Handle complex application state using React Context and Hooks
- Write custom React Hooks to encapsulate application logic
