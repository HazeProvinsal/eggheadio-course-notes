**It's time to publish our app!! üéâ**

- From teh [official docs](https://docs.amplify.aws/cli/hosting):

> Deploy and host your app using either Amplify Console or Amazon CloudFront/S3. The Amplify Console offers fully managed hosting with features such as instant cache invalidation and atomic deploys. For more control with setting up a CDN and hosting buckets, use CloudFront and S3.

```bash
amplify add hosting
? Select the environment setup: (Use arrow key)
‚ùØ DEV (S3 only with HTTP)
  PROD (S3 with CloudFront using HTTPS)
? hosting bucket name
? index doc of the website `index.html`
? error doc of the website `index.html`
```

- when this is ready, you can go to your command line and run `amplify publish` to deploy our new setup
- Your app should launch in a new window!! üéâ
