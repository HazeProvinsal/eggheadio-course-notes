- In order to link from one page to another in our Next.js site we're going to import the `Link` component from `next/link`
- ðŸ“œ [Next.js Documentation for Link](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/link)
- For static pages we just provide the Link component with a `href` property linking to the page
- For dynamic pages we must set the `href` property to our dynamic page (in our case `posts/[id]`) and also set the `as` property as it will be shown in the browser: `` as={`posts/${posts.id}`} ``
