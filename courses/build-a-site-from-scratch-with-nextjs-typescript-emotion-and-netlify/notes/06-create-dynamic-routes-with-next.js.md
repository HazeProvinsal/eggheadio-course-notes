# Create dynamic routes with next.js

- Next.js supports dynamic pages using `[]` in the filename to define the dynamic part of the route
- Create a folder called posts, and within it create a file called `posts/[title].tsx`

```js
import { Article } from "../../components/Article";

export default function Post() {
  return (
    <Article>
      <h1>Post title</h1>
      <p>Lorem ipsum</p>
    </Article>
  );
}
```

- This creates a function Post that renders an article component at any url we provide under the posts directory.
- To render dynamic content from the route we need to use `useRouter` and assign it to a variable

```js
import { useRouter } from "next/router";
```

- To use the data from the router, assign it to a variable then log out the `query` component to see what's contained inside of it:

```js
const router = useRouter();
console.log(router.query);
```

- In the conosle we'll see that there is a title variable, we can assign that to a variable and render it to the page:

```js
const {title} = router.query
...
<h1>Post Title: {title}</h1>
```

- Note that url parameters are also passed to the router and are available in the query object.
