- Next.js allows us to create multiple pages in the pages directory, and each page is associated with a route based on its filename.
- So if we create a file `pages/about.tsx` and export a component then we will have a page at <http://localhost:3000/about>

```js
export default function About() {
  return (
    <Article>
      <h1>About this blog</h1>
      <main>
        <p>This is the best blog ever</p>
      </main>
    </Article>
  );
}
```

- The Article component (`components/Article.tsx`):

```js
import styled from "@emotion/styled";

export const Article = styled.article`
  margin: 0 auto;
  max-width: 500px;
`;
```

- The url will be the same as the filename. If the file is nested inside of a directory under pages, then the route will be nested in the same way.
- These are just React components so you can import other comoponents and use them when creating pages.
- These pages are generated in advance by Next.js by default
