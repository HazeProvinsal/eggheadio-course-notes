- We're going to clean out the content and set up how we're going to be styling our site
- 📝 In later versions of Next.js (At least in 9.5.3) many of the changes that Tomasz makes to the css styles are already present in the `create-next-app` template.
- 📝 The `<style>` tags are no longer present in the `index.tsx` file in later versions of the `create-next-app`, additionally the `_app.js` file is present by default. Let's rename it to `_app.tsx`
- Next.js uses the `App` component to initialize pages. You can override page initialization which allows us to add global.css files. 📝 The `global.css` file file is in the `styles/` folder of the project in newer versions of `create-next-app`. 📜 [Documentation Link](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-app)
- The updated `_app.tsx` file should look similar to this:

```js
import "../styles/globals.css";
import { AppProps } from "next/app";

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />;
}

export default MyApp;
```

- You can change the font file in `global.css` to verify that global styles are working.
