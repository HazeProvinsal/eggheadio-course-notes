- Because we are deploying with Netlify we can easily deploy a form to collect user Feedback.
- We're creating a `FeedbackForm` component

```js
function FeedbackForm() {
  return (
    <form name="feedback" method="post" data-netlify="true" action="/thankyou">
      <input type="hidden" name="form-name" value="feedback" />
      <p>
        <label>
          Your name:
          <br />
          <input type="text" name="name" />
        </label>
      </p>
      <p>
        <label>
          Feedback:
          <br />
          <textarea name="message" />
        </label>
      </p>
      <p>
        <button type="submit">Send</button>
      </p>
    </form>
  );
}

export { FeedbackForm };
```

- Important thing to note, the `data-netlify='true'` helps Netlify's bots know to use this form. ðŸ“œ [Netlify Form Documentation](https://docs.netlify.com/forms/setup/)
- Because we're using a static site we have to include a hidden input ðŸ“œ [Netlify Blog on Forms with Static Site Generators](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2017/07/20/how-to-integrate-netlifys-form-handling-in-a-react-app/?_ga=2.233132382.1976009725.1599930688-2087236484.1599165952#form-handling-with-static-site-generators)
- The `action` property will take the user to that page after they press the button. Create a page at `/thankyou` to customize the thank you message.
- Netlify collects the feedback from these forms and you can export the data as a CSV
- ðŸ’¡ How could you adjust this form to collect emails for your newsletter?
