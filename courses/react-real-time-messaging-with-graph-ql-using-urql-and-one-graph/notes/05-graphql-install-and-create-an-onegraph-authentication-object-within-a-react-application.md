## Authentication

The last thing we need to implement in order to fetch data from our services is authentication. `OneGraph` provides a package called [onegraph-auth](https://www.onegraph.com/docs/) that we can import into our project.

```bash
yarn add onegraph-auth
```

We can create a new auth instance by passing `onegraph-auth` our `OneGraph` `appId`.

```js
// src/utils/auth.js

import OneGraphAuth from 'onegraph-auth'

export const auth = OneGraphAuth({
  appId: APP_ID,
})
```
