# Pass Data Between Screens when Navigating with StackNavigator

**[ðŸ“¹ Video](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-native-pass-data-between-screens-when-navigating-with-stacknavigator)**

## Passing navigation props

Sometimes we need to pass additional props to another screen - such as an `id` for the selected item. Parameters can be passed as the second argument to the `navigate()` function.

```
this.props.navigation.navigate('Info', {
	place: this.state.place
})
```

Inside the `Info` screen we can now access the params on the `navigation` prop.

```jsx
this.props.navigation.getParam('place')
```
