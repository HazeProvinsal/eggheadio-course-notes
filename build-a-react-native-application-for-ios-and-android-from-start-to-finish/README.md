## About üîç

If you already know React, then React Native is a great way to build mobile apps for iOS and Android. Of course, web and mobile apps are very different to build ‚Äî but this course serves as your guide.

In this course, we‚Äôll build a mobile app from start to release with React Native for both iOS and Android. Prior React experience is required, but you don‚Äôt have to know anything about mobile development to participate.

Throughout the course, we‚Äôll be building a ‚ÄúRestaurant Review‚Äù app. We‚Äôll use all the standard mobile UI elements like text, images, form inputs, buttons, scroll views, and icons, and we‚Äôll show several navigation techniques like push, modal, and tabs. The app will make HTTP API calls to a server and will store data on the device with AsyncStorage. Finally, we‚Äôll specify a custom app icon and splash screen, deploy the app to a physical device, and prepare the app for release to the App Store and Play Store or for ad-hoc release.

## ‚ùóSignificant Changes

This course uses react-navigation version 2. The current version is 5 and contains a slightly different API. The concepts of stack and tab navigation are the same, so for consistency with the videos install version 2, and use the corresponding [docs](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/2.x/getting-started/).

This course uses React Native's AsyncStorage, however, this is now deprecated. It is recommended to use the [React Native Community Async Storage](https://react-native-community.github.io/async-storage/docs/install) which needs to be installed from NPM.

Xcode may display different options if you are running a newer version - follow [Apple's Distributing Your App for Beta Testing and Releases](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/distributing_your_app_for_beta_testing_and_releases) guide for more information.
