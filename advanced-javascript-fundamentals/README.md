These notes are intended to be used and studied in tandem with Tyler Clark's [Advanced JavaScript Foundations](https://egghead.io/courses/advanced-javascript-foundations) egghead course.

Some question(s) are outlined in the essential questions section of the README for you to think about as you take the workshop. There is no 'definitive' answer to these questions but as you learn, you'll develop a more contextualized answer.

Right below is the intended outcomes of the course, these are the skills and knowledge you will learn that you can take to any application to use.

## Outcomes:
- Understanding Implicit vs Explicit Coercion
- How Prototypal Inheritance Works in JS
- Use the ES6 Class Keyword
- Understand Lexical vs. Dynamic Scope
- Create New Objects with the New Keyword

## 01. [Overview](https://egghead.io/courses/advanced-javascript-foundations)

The code for this course can be found [here in Tyler's repository](https://github.com/twclark0/advanced-javascript-fundamentals).

---

It all starts with syntax. From there, once you‚Äôve got the concepts down, you can move into using a framework where you figure out how to make things ‚Äújust work‚Äù.

Everything is great, until it‚Äôs not.

If someone put you on the spot right now and asked you to explain this, would they like your answer?

What about prototypal inheritance or coercion?

In this workshop, you‚Äôll be taking things to the next level, shining a light into ‚Äúblack-box‚Äù concepts like prototypes, the this keyword, and what primitive types are.

Tyler will walk you through each concept, and build your understanding through examples in the areas you need to know.
