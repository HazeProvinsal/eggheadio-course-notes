# Exercises

As you work through this course, Khaled has developed exercises for you to test your knowledge as you go along. You'll notice in specific lesson notes that there is an exercise section that will give you a brief for what challenges you are supposed to tackle.

For each exercise, if you'd like more context and clues as to the solution you can navigate to the individual exercise pages:

- [01 Extract pages from CRA to Gatsby](01-extract-pages-from-CRA-to-gatsby.md)
- [02 Install a Gatsby Plugin](02-install-a-plugin.md)
- [03 Query data with GraphQL in Gatsby](03-query-data.md)

You will have a codesandbox starter available to you for each exercise which is set up with the right configuration for you to focus on the task at hand.

We encourage you to give the exercises a go before taking a look at the solutions!
