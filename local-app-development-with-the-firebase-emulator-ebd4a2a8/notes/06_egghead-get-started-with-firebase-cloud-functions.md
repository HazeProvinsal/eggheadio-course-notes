  "After you write and deploy a function, Google's servers begin to manage the function immediately. You can fire the function directly with an HTTP request, or, in the case of background functions, Google's servers will listen for events and run the function when it is triggered." - **[Firebase Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions)**
