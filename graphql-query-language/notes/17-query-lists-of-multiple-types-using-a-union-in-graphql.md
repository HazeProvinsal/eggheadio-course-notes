## Summary

In this lesson we learn about unions and how to write queries that obtain a list of multiple types.

## Notes

In the refactored pet library there are some more queries that we haven't had a look at yet, `familyPets` and `exoticPets`.

If you open up the schema and click on `familyPets`, you will see some helpful documentation that says `"This query returns a list of Family Pets, either a Cat or Dog."`

Another useful data structure when working with GraphQL is a `union`.

Use a union to return lists of multiple types.

Unions don't share any fields, so if we try to query the `name` field, we will get an error.

```
"Cannot query field \"name\" on type \"FamilyPet\". Did you mean to use an inline fragment on \"Pet\", \"Cat\", or \"Dog\"?"
```

<TimeStamp start="1:01" end="1:30">

If we want to query additional pet data, we can use inline fragments.

We will see that the error now goes away, and we get back out data. ðŸ¥³
