## Summary

In this lesson we learn how to use fragments.

## Notes

<TimeStamp start="0:00" end="0:10">

Fragments are selection sets that can be used across multiple queries. They allow us to refactor redundant selection sets, and they are essential when querying unions or interface types.

</TimeStamp>

<TimeStamp start="0:28" end="0:43">

To make this selection set reusable, we can use a fragment. A fragment is like a wrapper around several fields.

We are going to create a fragment called `PetDetails` which is on type `Pet`. We then copy and paste the fields from the previous `allPets` query inside the fragment.

</TimeStamp>

<TimeStamp start="0:44" end="0:49">

Afterwards we can use spread syntax to push all of the pet details into the `allPets` query.

</TimeStamp>

<TimeStamp start="0:50" end="0:53">

We are still able to send the query along with all of the fields. ðŸ¥³

</TimeStamp>

<TimeStamp start="0:54" end="1:04">

We can adjust the fragment and add additional fields such as `photo`. You'll see that the data returned from the `allPets` query now includes a thumbnail.

</TimeStamp>

<TimeStamp start="1:05" end="1:19">

Now we're going to add on to the to query a little bit. We are going to add `petById` and pass in "C-1". We can also reuse `PetDetails`.

</TimeStamp>

<TimeStamp start="1:20" end="1:30">

We can also add additional fields along side of the fragment. Here we're going to add `inCareOf`, `name` and `username`.

</TimeStamp>

<TimeStamp start="1:31" end="1:52">

We can now create another fragment for customer details. We specify that these fields come from the `Customer` type. We'll add `name` and `username` from `inCareOf` and push those fields into the query.
