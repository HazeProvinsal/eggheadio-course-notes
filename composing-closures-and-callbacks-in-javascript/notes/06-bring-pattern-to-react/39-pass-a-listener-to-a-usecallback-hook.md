# Pass a Listener to a useCallback Hook

**[üìπ Video](https://egghead.io/lessons/egghead-pass-a-listener-to-a-usecallback-hook)**

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Remember that **a function can receive different values**, this is really important to understand how this code works!
- Let's see the next code and try to follow the call stack or execution order:

```js
let listener
let callbackListener = (value) => {
  if (typeof value === "function") {
    listener = value
    return
  }
  listener(value)
}

let App = () => {
  let onInput = useCallback(callbackListener)
  let state = useBroadcaster(targetValue(onInput))
  return (
    <div>
      <input type="text" onInput={onInput} />
      <p>{state}</p>
    </div>
  )
}

let targetValue = map((event) => event.target.value)

let useBroadcaster = (broadcaster, deps = []) => {
  let [state, setState] = useState(null)
  useEffect(() => {
    broadcaster(setState)
  }, deps)

  return state
}
```

Let's Walkthrough a normal render execution:

### React renders the app for the first time

- `onInput` is set to `callbackListener`, and that means that the return value of it can be different depending on the value type this function accepts.
- `callbackListener` has a guard against if the value passed is a function or not. \*\*Here's how you can use `onInput` as a broadcaster (passing it to the `useBroadcaster` wrapped in `targetValue`) and as a Listener (passed to the input's`onInput` prop).
- the first time the broadcaster is called, is inside the `useBroadcaster` custom hook, inside the `useEffect` (in this case it will be called just once and after the first render, because we are passing an empty array as dependencies of the `useEffect`). Here, the variable `listener`will be assigned to `setState`, defined inside the `useBroadcaster` hook ü§Ø

### `listener` === `setState`

- after the first render, the value passed to the `callbackListener` function will not be of type function, so all the values will be passed to `listener`, and because `listener === setState`, setState will be called with the values, and the component will re-render with the new value.

Isn't it awesome that we can do this with just a couple of functions?!? ‚ù§Ô∏èüöÄ
