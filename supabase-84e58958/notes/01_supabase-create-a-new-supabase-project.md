After creating the project in Supabase, Supabase will create two main things for us: 

1. Building a Database, which will be a [PostgresSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database. 
2. Attach a rest API, as well as real-time subscription support. 

You can find Supabase documentation [here](https://supabase.io/docs).
