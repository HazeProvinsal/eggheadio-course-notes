# Rubric Score

**Are there opportunities for self-assessment? (1-4): 1**
The course offers no self assessment.

**Is the course content high quality? (1-4): 4**
Easy to follow, great explanations. I was able to understand even with very little Redux and RxJS experience.

**Is the course content current and up to date? (1-4): 2**
With the introduction of pipeable operators in RxJS and with various changes to redux-observable, much of the code in this course required some form of alteration before it could run on the newest versions of these libraries. However, these fixes were easy to make, and, once the code had been updated, the functionality was largely the same as was demonstrated in the course. Despite the updates to how the concepts are implemented, the concepts themselves are still current.

**Does the content meet the stated learning goals? (1-4): 4**
The stated learning goals are concise and they are all obviously addressed/demonstrated in the course.

**Does the content incorporate proof (to the learner and others) that the stated learning goals were achieved? (1-4): 2**
Many of the lessons of the course build off of previously demonstrated concepts, so the course has a sort of implicit proof that learning goals are being addressed and built upon. However, there are no explicit forms of proof.

**Is the course material evergreen? (1-4): 2**
Changes in new versions of RxJS and redux-observable break a lot of the code presented in this course. However, it is not difficult to migrate the code to work on new versions of the library because the concepts are still evergreen.

**How much depth of knowledge does the course provide? (1-4): 4**
Course does a great job of explaining patterns and concepts alongside their application in the code. Many of the lessons build off of one another and address edge cases that one may have to deal with while applying redux-observable and RxJS.

**Is the course actionable? (1-4): 3**
The core concepts and patterns are demonstrated at a level deep enough for the viewer to be able to understand and apply them in another context. However, it is up to the learner to take the lead and do so.

**Average Score: 2.75**
