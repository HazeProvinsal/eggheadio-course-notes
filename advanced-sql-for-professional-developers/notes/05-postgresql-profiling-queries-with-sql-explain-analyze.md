# [Profiling Queries with Explain Analyze](https://egghead.io/lessons/postgresql-profiling-queries-with-explain-analyze)

## Query Performance and Optimization

<TimeStamp start="0:07" end="0:12">

We check query performance by using the `explain` command.

```bash
explain select * from users;
```

</TimeStamp>

<TimeStamp start="0:13" end="0:27">

This will return an execution plan which is generated by Postgres. For the command above, the execution plan will show how the table reference by statement will be scanned.

</TimeStamp>

The most important thing to note is the `cost`.

### How `cost` Works

The `cost` output shows two different values that are separated by 2 dots --> **startup cost**..**total cost**

<TimeStamp start="0:35" end="0:55">

**Startup cost**: The time it takes for the first row to be returned.
**Total cost**: The time it will take for all of the rows from our query to be returned.

</TimeStamp>

Here's a little visual to make this easier to visualize :)

## Using Different Formats for `explain` Output

We can view the same output in different formats like JSON, YAML, XML etc. We do this by typing the following:

<TimeStamp start="1:11" end="1:21">

```bash
explain (format json) select form Users;
```

</TimeStamp>

If you want to see this in another format, just replace `json` with your desired format.

## How `verbose` with `explain`

<TimeStamp start="1:22" end="1:35">

We can get even more output and information from `explain` by using the `verbose` option.

Using `verbose` will show us what **schema** the table exist on and the columns in the table.

</TimeStamp>

## `explain` By Itself is Basically a Simulator

<TimeStamp start="1:39" end="1:50">

One of the most important things to remember about `explain` is that when we call it, we don't actually run our query. It acts more like a simulator. Really, the planner just shows estimates aka guesses.

So running `explain update users set email = null` doesn't actually update the `users` table.

</TimeStamp>

### For Real `explain` Output

<TimeStamp start="1:55" end="2:03">

If we want the actually want 100% accurate output, run `explain` with `analyze`.

```bash
explain analyze update users set email = null;
```

</TimeStamp>

<TimeStamp start="2:17" end="2:25">

Just remember, **running `explain analyze` will actually run your query**.

</TimeStamp>

## Different Types of Scans

When we run `explain select * from users;`, the `select` initiates a **sequential scan**. So the select statement loops over every single row until the end of the table.

<TimeStamp start="2:39" end="2:45">

The **index scan** is faster. Running this kind of command:

```sql
explain select * from users where user_handle = `a0eebc99-9c0b-4ef8-bb6d-6bb9bd380a11`;
```

</TimeStamp>

Although index scan can be faster, it's startup cost can be longer than sequential scan in some cases.

### The `cost` of Using Options

In the example above, the `where` option was used. It's important to remember for options like `where` and `join` will end up affecting the `cost`.

## When to Use Which Option

It can be hard to determine which options will have the most optimal results with `cost`. But each table is different. To find the best, most optimal options, you'll have to run them through a profiler.
