## Summary

`urql` is a light-weight data fetching library that we can use to send queries and mutations to our `OneGraph` endpoint. It provides us with some convenient variables to determine whether our application is in a loading or error state, or whether we have the data required to display our component.

## Create React App

In this video we will create a new React application using the `create-react-app` package.

```bash
npx create-react-app name-of-our-app
```

The `create-react-app` package allows us to quickly create a React application without needing to write a bunch of boilerplate code, or configure Webpack, babel etc. Feel free to swap this out with your own custom React application, or another framework built on React - such as Next or Gatsby - but this may take some extra configuration and googling.

## Urql

`urql` is a data fetching library that we can use to send queries and mutations to our GraphQL API (OneGraph). In order to specify queries, `urql` also requires the `graphql` package.

`yarn add urql graphql`

Now we need to create an `urql` client and wrap our application in their provider.

```js
// src/index.js

// other imports
import {createClient, Provider} from 'urql'

const client = createClient({
  url: 'replace-with-graphql-endpoint-from-onegraph',
})

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <Provider value={client}>
      <App />
    </Provider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root'),
)
```

Now from within any of our React components we can declare a GraphQL query that describes the data our component wants.

```js
const QUERY = `
  query {
    npm {
      package(name: "graphql") {
        name
      }
    }
    devTo {
      articles {
        nodes {
          title
        }
      }
    }
  }
`
```

Then we can pass this query to the useQuery hook from `urql`. This hook returns the result of the query, as well as a function to trigger this query again.

```
const [result, reExecuteQuery] = useQuery({ query: QUERY })
```

> Note: the query gets executed as soon as the component is mounted, if we want to re-run this query after some user action - such as clicking a button to add a todo - we would call the `reExecuteQuery` function.

Now, `console.log({result})` the result from the Query and open the developer tools. You'll see that the same data structure from our GraphiQL Editor is being returned in our application.
