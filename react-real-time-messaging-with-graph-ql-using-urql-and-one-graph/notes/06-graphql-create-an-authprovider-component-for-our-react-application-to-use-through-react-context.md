## Summary
We can use React Context to build an `AuthProvider` component to handle our auth logic. Probably best to just copy the [AuthContext.js](https://github.com/theianjones/egghead-graphql-subscriptions/blob/master/04-setUpAuthenticationWithUrql/src/contexts/AuthContext.js) file from the [course repo](https://github.com/theianjones/egghead-graphql-subscriptions), as it is quite lengthy. Basically what this file does is:

1. Creates a new `onegraph-auth` instance
2. Sets the headers for our authenticated GraphQL requests
3. Provides convenient login and logout functions
